Description: We define a notion of module over a monad and use it to
             propose a new definition (or semantics) for abstract
             syntax (with binding constructions).  Using our notion of
             module, we build a category of `exponential' monads,
             which can be understood as the category of
             lambda-calculi, and prove that it has an initial object
             (the pure untyped lambda-calculus).
